# Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis 
## Assignment 1

The file containing the data to recreate the plots is household_power_consumption_cut.txt. It has been modified using head, grep and cat to reduce the size as only 2 days of the file are needed.

The R scripts plot1 to plot4 produce the respective files plot1.png to plot4.png to demonstrate the use of plots for exploratory data analysis, i.e. get a feel for the data.
